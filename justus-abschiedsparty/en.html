     Hello y'all,
    </div>
   </div>
   <div id="vstripeT"></div>
   <div>
    <div>
     No, I'm not moving to Texas, and not to Antarctica either. Just a bit
     closer to the <i>Arctic</i> circle!
     <br>
     But move I do, almost certainly, after all this time in Cologne.

    <div>
     The time in Cologne was nice, not least because of the people I
     got to meet. Actually though, many of you I've not seen much for quite
     a while!
    </div>
   </div>
   <div>
    <div>
     That's why I'd like to invite you to a farewell party.
     <br>
     Unfortunately I have a hard time estimating how many people will
     actually come. Hopefully not too few!
     <br>
     That's why this is first just an invitation
     to <a href="https://doodle.com/poll/697hbcbfdueppwu9">a Doodle poll</a>,
     which will then decide what the plan is for the actual thing.

  <div class="miscinfo">
   Please also let me know how I should inform you where and when the party will take place!
   Ideally, with an E-Mail address, or else a phone number which it's possible to actually <i>call</i>...
   <br>
   Probably, I will set it up in a pub, or I may rent some room for the occasion.
   Or in case the interest is only rather sparse after all, it'll be just a barrel
   of beer at my flat.
  </div>
  <div>
   Hope to see you then,
   <br>
