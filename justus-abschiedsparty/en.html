     Hello y'all,

    <div>
     No, I'm not moving to Texas, and not to Antarctica either. Just a bit
     closer to the <i>Arctic</i> circle!
     <br>
     But move I do, almost certainly, after all this time in Cologne.

     The time in Cologne was nice, not least because of the people I

   The Kozmic Blue Justus Farewell Concert
  </h2>
  <div class="miscinfo">
   It all will take place <b>Fr, 2019-5-3</b>, 7 pm, in the <i>Brasserie Aller Kolör</i>
   <pre>
    Alteburger Str. 15a
    50678 Köln
   </pre>
   <il>
    <li>Concert-wise it'll be: free entry, condition: <em>be quiet and listen</em>!</li>
    <li>Party-wise it'll be: I give out a few rounds of Kölsch, condition: <em>be loud and laugh</em>!</li>
   </il>
   <br>
   Apart from that, the Brasserie will sell drinks as usual.<br>Some of you have asked if they should bring food. I'm afraid there won't be much space for that, so it's more just <i>snacks</i>.
  </div>
  <div>
   Hope to see you then,
   <br>
   <i>Justus</i>
